# Personal-Profile
This personal website serves as my digital interface, designed to showcase my skills and experience in web and mobile application development. The page features a modern and responsive design that adapts to all screen sizes.

Among its most prominent features is support for both Arabic and English languages, offering seamless text switching and dynamic page direction changes (from left-to-right and vice-versa). The website also provides a dark and light mode option for user comfort, with preferences saved for future visits.

The page includes engaging interactions and visual animations, such as the transition of control buttons based on the selected language and the smooth appearance of content upon scrolling. It stands as a platform to display my technical skills and projects in a professional and interactive manner.
